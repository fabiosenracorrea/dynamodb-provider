# AI config files

Here you'll find your `CLAUDE.md` and the likes templates to instruct exactly how this library behaves without consuming too much context.

This is a progressive work. We'll provide **multiple files and you join/edit them together however you may want it**.

- [entities](./entities.md) - Defines how entity definition and usage via `from({...})` works. All params explained. **no partition or collection mention**
- [partitions](./partitions.md) - Only whats relevant to `schema.createPartition()` - references `./entities.md` and `collection.md`
